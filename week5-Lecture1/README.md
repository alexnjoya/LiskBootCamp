## üìñ Introduction

Smart contracts on Ethereum are designed to be **immutable** by default. Once deployed, their code cannot be modified. While this immutability provides security guarantees, it also presents challenges when bugs need to be fixed or functionality needs to be enhanced.

**Proxy patterns** address this limitation by separating a contract's **storage** from its **logic**, enabling upgrades while preserving state and contract addresses. The **EIP-1967 Transparent Proxy Pattern** is one of the most widely adopted standards for implementing upgradeable contracts.

---

## ‚ùó The Problem with Upgradeable Contracts

When implementing upgradeable contracts through proxies, several challenges emerge:

* **Storage Collision**: Storage variables in the proxy might conflict with those in the implementation contract.
* **Function Selector Clashing**: Admin functions in the proxy might have the same selectors as functions in the implementation.
* **Storage Layout Preservation**: When upgrading, the new implementation must maintain the storage layout of the previous version.
* **Delegated Calls**: The proxy must correctly forward calls to the implementation while returning data properly.

---

## üß± Proxy Patterns Overview

Before diving into EIP-1967, it's helpful to understand the evolution of proxy patterns:

* **Simple Proxy**: The most basic pattern using `delegatecall` with hardcoded storage slots.
* **Unstructured Storage Proxy**: Uses specific storage slots determined by complex hashing to avoid collisions.
* **Transparent Proxy Pattern**: Extends unstructured storage by solving function selector clashing.
* **UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)**: Places upgrade logic in the implementation contract rather than the proxy.
* **Diamond Pattern**: Enables multi-facet proxies with multiple implementation contracts.

---

## üîç The EIP-1967 Transparent Proxy Pattern

The EIP-1967 standard defines specific storage slots for proxy-related information, allowing tools like block explorers to properly identify and display proxy contracts. It also addresses the **storage collision** problem and provides a framework for upgradeable contracts.

---

## üß© Key Components

* **Proxy Contract**: Receives user calls and forwards them to the implementation using `delegatecall`.
* **Implementation Contract**: Contains the actual business logic but doesn't store state.
* **Admin / ProxyAdmin**: Controls the upgrade process, separate from regular users.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Storage Slots

EIP-1967 defines standardized storage slots to avoid collisions:

* **Implementation Slot**:
  `0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc`

  * Derived from: `bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip1967.proxy.implementation')) - 1)`
  * Stores the address of the logic/implementation contract

* **Admin Slot**:
  `0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103`

  * Derived from: `bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip1967.proxy.admin')) - 1)`
  * Stores the address that can upgrade the proxy

* **Beacon Slot (less commonly used)**:
  `0xa3f0ad74e5423aebfd80d3ef4346578335a9a72aeaee59ff6cb3582b35133d50`

  * Derived from: `bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip1967.proxy.beacon')) - 1)`
  * Used in beacon proxy patterns for upgrading multiple proxies at once

> These slots were chosen to be highly unlikely to clash with regular contract storage by being derived from a hash with a `-1` offset.

## üîÅ Function Call Flow

1. When a call comes into the proxy, it first checks if the caller is the admin.
2. If the caller is the admin, it allows access to **admin functions** (like upgrades) but prevents access to **implementation functions**.
3. If the caller is not the admin, all calls are **forwarded to the implementation** via `delegatecall`.

This separation prevents function selector clashing by ensuring admin calls and user calls are handled differently.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Addressing Function Selector Clashing

Function selector clashing occurs when a function in the proxy contract (like `upgradeTo(address)`) has the same 4-byte selector as a function in the implementation. The Transparent Proxy Pattern solves this by:

* Checking `msg.sender` against the admin address before deciding how to handle the call
* If `msg.sender` is the admin, only proxy functions can be called
* If `msg.sender` is not the admin, all calls are forwarded to the implementation

This design ensures that:

* **Regular users** can never accidentally call admin functions
* **Admin** can never accidentally call implementation functions through the proxy

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

The implementation in this repository contains three main contracts:

* `TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol`: The main proxy contract implementing EIP-1967
* `ProxyAdmin.sol`: Contract to manage proxy upgrades
* `Box.sol` and `BoxV2.sol`: Sample implementation contracts to demonstrate upgrades

**Key aspects of the implementation:**

* Uses `delegatecall` to forward calls to the implementation
* Stores implementation address in EIP-1967 defined storage slot
* Emits events on upgrades for better off-chain tracking
* Implements function call routing based on caller identity
* Uses `assembly` for proper handling of `delegatecall` return data

---

## üîê Security Considerations

When using transparent proxies, keep these security points in mind:

* **Admin Access Control**: The admin has complete control over the contract logic and can potentially modify it maliciously.
* **Initializers**: Since constructors in implementation contracts are not executed, use **initializer functions** and ensure they can only be called once.
* **Storage Layout**: Never change the order of storage variables when upgrading‚Äîonly append new ones.
* **Function Selectors**: Be aware of potential selector clashes even with the routing mechanism.
* **State Variables**: Never initialize state variables at declaration in implementation contracts.
* **Security Audits**: Have upgradeable contracts thoroughly audited before deployment.
